# Speech-to-Text System Using Deep Learning

---

## Project Overview
This project focuses on converting spoken language into written text using Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning techniques. The system captures audio input through a microphone or audio files and processes it using a deep learning-based speech recognition model. It analyzes speech patterns and generates accurate textual output in real time. This system improves accessibility and enhances human–computer interaction.

## Objectives
- To develop an automated system that converts speech into text accurately  
- To reduce manual typing effort using voice-based input  
- To support real-time speech recognition  
- To improve accessibility for users with physical disabilities  
- To utilize deep learning models for better speech recognition accuracy

## Problem Statement
Manual typing is time-consuming and not suitable for hands-free environments or users with physical limitations. Variations in accents, speech speed, and background noise make speech recognition challenging. There is a need for an intelligent speech-to-text system that can accurately and efficiently convert spoken language into text using deep learning techniques.
